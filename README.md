# algo

This repository contains my personal collection of modern C++ utilities for algorithms and data structures, including segment trees, monoid wrappers, and accumulators. It's not meant to be a polished library â€” just the tools I use in contests and experiments, organized for reuse and archival. Feel free to explore or borrow from it, but expect sharp edges.
