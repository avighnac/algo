# algo

This repository contains my personal collection of modern C++ utilities for algorithms and data structures, including segment trees, monoid wrappers, and accumulators. It's not meant to be a polished library: just the tools I use in contests and experiments, organized for reuse and archival. Feel free to explore or borrow from it, but expect sharp edges.

See the `examples/` directory for usage examples and demonstrations.

**Note**: Most of this code relies on C++20 features and won't compile with earlier standards.

Additionally, I do not claim to have written all of the code under `src/experimental`, and I have given credit to the places I took the code from.
